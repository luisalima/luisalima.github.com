Yes, today I am in "documentation" mode, which means "bloggation" mode :-)

Just installed this gem -- [Better errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors). It is a gem meant to help you out in development mode that replaces the standard Rails error page with a wayyyy better and more useful error page, featuring full stack trace, source code inspection for all stack frames, local and instance variable inspection, etc.

I'm going to try it out today, but definitely beats the time spent looking at development logs (even if they are as clean and contained as mine after doing the changes described in [this post](/blog/2012/12/13/disabling-nagging-logs-in-rails)).

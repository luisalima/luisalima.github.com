Analytics.js
------------

I don't know whether this library is very common, but it definitely shows a lot of promise:

[Segmentio's Analytics.js](http://segmentio.github.com/analytics.js/)

It provides provider-agnostic hooks to route to analytics services. They also have a hosted version where the analytics services can be changed without touching the code. Looks really clean and neat.

Nice video: to_proc
-------------------

[This video by CooperPress](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aISNtCAZlMg) explains in a very clear fashion how to use the "to_proc" feature of Ruby (and understand some weird code you might come across). It is also well worth it to subscribe to [their other videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/CooperPress?feature=watch).

Faster Rails partial rendering and caching
------------------------------------------

I sure will try out [this gem (multi_fetch_fragments)](http://ninjasandrobots.com/rails-faster-partial-rendering-and-caching/) to optimize Rails when I get to that point of my work...

Indexes in Rails databases
--------------------------

[Extremely good article by Tom Ward on using indexes in rails associations](http://tomafro.net/2009/08/using-indexes-in-rails-index-your-associations). An excellent guide to determine what indexes your app should include (no more, no less).

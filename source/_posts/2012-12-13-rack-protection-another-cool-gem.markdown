This one I haven't evaluated yet, but looks promising: [Rack Protection](http://rkh.github.com/rack-protection/), to prevent typical web attacks such as [cross site request forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery), [cross site scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross_site_scripting), [clickjacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking), directory traversal, [session hijacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_hijacking_attack) and IP spoofing.

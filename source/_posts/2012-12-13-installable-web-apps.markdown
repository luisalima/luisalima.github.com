[Very interesting remark from MIT Technology Review](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/508741/installable-web-apps-will-be-the-next-tech-battleground/) on how installable web apps will be the next tech background. To be honest... Hope not. This should be the next big thing, especially for developers, who can make their apps ubiquitous with a little extra effort... It will be interesting to see Apple's reaction, though.

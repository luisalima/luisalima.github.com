    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, for those who don't know it (I just discovered about it), if you want to validate the presence of a boolean field, you can't do it with validates_presence_of.</p>

<p>So, suppose that we have a model like</p>

<pre><code>
# == Schema Information
# Table name: Bla
#  test       :boolean
class Bla < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :test
</code></pre>


<p>For example, if I had used validates_presence_of :test in the example above, it would have failed miserably because false.blank? is true -- so in practice, we could have never set bla.test to false, since it would make the validation fail (<a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Validations/ClassMethods/validates_presence_of">more details here</a>).</p>

<p>So I set out to try this out:</p>

<pre><code>
validates_inclusion_of :test, :in => [true, false]
</code></pre>


<p>and test it like this:</p>

<pre><code>
it {should_not allow_value("bla").for(:completed)}
</code></pre>


<p>and it still failed miserably.</p>

<p>Now I was puzzled... So I tried this one out:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4348179.js?file=bla.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># == Schema Information
#
# Table name: Bla
#  test       :boolean

class Bla &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :test
  before_validation :test_present
  def test_present
  	puts &quot;TEST PRESENT&quot;
  	puts self.test
  	errors.add(:test, &quot;Must be set to true or false&quot;) if !([true, false].include?(self.test))
  end
  
# Same behavior with validate, before_save, before_validation:
b = Bla.new
b.test = &quot;bla&quot;
b.save
# prints
# TEST PRESENT
# false

# found out about this while testing
# 	it {should_not allow_value(:other).for(:completed)}
# I know that I don't need to test that the boolean will be true or false, the db does it for me...
# but I'm wondering... does the test attribute ever get to be &quot;bla&quot;?
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>I was thinking that at some point the test attribute would be set to "bla", but since the field is a boolean, inserting other values will always evaluate to false. So we don't have to go to all this trouble: this way we can validate the presence, but we never need to validate whether the value itself is valid.

    <link href="http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/20/how-i-test-part-iii/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-20T16:48:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/20/how-i-test-part-iii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why RSpec? That is a good question. My main reason for using RSpec right now is because I want to have a testing + documentation + TODO bundle, all in one, like a shampoo:</p>

<ul>
<li>testing -- ok, RSpec does make things a tad more complicated for testing. I believe that testing actually makes you learn more about what you code, and RSpec, being a DSL, can make things esoteric enough that sometimes you don't know exactly what you're testing (I confess that I like Test::Unit more because it's simpler for developers to read -- assert that this gives this result). But, on the other hand, you have shoulda! :-)</li>
<li>documentation -- the exact same thing that makes testing a bit more esoteric, makes documentation a piece of cake. You want to know how something works? Just read the tests. And RSpec does make that side of testing much clearer.</li>
<li>TODO -- yup, that's right. If you have features that you want to implement later on, just add a "pending" spec with the description of what you want to do. Of course that you can do that in Test::Unit as well, but it's not as beautiful and immediate as in RSpec.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course that I'm really just beginning and I might change my mind eventually. <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/dhh-offended-by-rspec-debate-4610.html">Even the creator of Rails argues against RSPec</a>, and there are quite a few arguments against it (if you missed the link, here's an <a href="http://objectreload.com/articles/2010/09/thoughts-on-testing-part-1.html">excellent blog post on that</a>).</p>

<p>By the way, I'm abiding by this rule from the last post:</p>

<p>"- Keep things flat — deeply nested contexts are ugly as they hinder readability of your test cases. Split your tests up into different files if they’re getting too long."</p>

<p>I was trying to make things DRY in the tests, and then I thought... why bother, exactly? It's better if they are more readable, for the sake of documentation as stated above. Amen, brothers.</p>

<h2>Why not Cucumber for request specs?</h2>

<p>All the reasons are in this <a href="http://epimetrics.com/entries/3129">excellent post</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/19/how-i-test-part-ii/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-19T10:17:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/19/how-i-test-part-ii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Testing models</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html">rails guides</a>:</p>

<p>"Ideally, you would like to include a test for everything which could possibly break. It’s a good practice to have at least one test for each of your validations and at least one test for every method in your model."</p>

<p>Which leads me to...</p>

<h2>Why I use shoulda</h2>

<p>I think that the best thing is just to take a peek at <a href="http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/rspec_shoulda/">The shoulda cheat sheets</a>.</p>

<p>You actually get a guide of what to test by looking at the cheat sheet! It's too bad that it's not up to date (actually I think that the whole site is not up to date -- even the gem doesn't work anymore, which I think is too bad :-( )</p>

<p>Furthermore, it's great for lazy people and it's definitely easier on the eyes. Just check the following example:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4339197.js?file=shoulda_model.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># without shoulda... tons of code :-)
it &quot;should belong to person&quot; do
	Model.reflect_on_association(:person).macro.should == :belongs_to
end

# with shoulda... one-liner!
it{should belong_to(:person)}
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Convinced? ;-)</p>

<h2>What I test exactly with shoulda</h2>

<p>I go through the whole list of shoulda macros for models, and I just use and abuse them. Since the cheat sheet is not up to date, I created a new one (just for models for now) at:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4339490.js?file=shoulda_cheat_model.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># updated from the original @ http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/rspec_shoulda
# just a subset -- models -- is included here. I'll update this, and create cheat sheets for others, as I go along.
# I marked the ones I added with NEW and also added the links to the corresponding code, as I think it's useful.
# Any comments/corrections are welcome!

<p>Yes, it's a bit tedious. But (1) you make sure that you are actually testing all these details, which is extremely useful when you are constantly refactoring your code, and (2) it's not that slow with the multiple cursors of Sublime Text 2. You just need to have a scaffold.</p>

<h2>What I test without shoulda</h2>

<p>Apart from model methods, is there that much to test without shoulda? I test:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any model methods, extensively</li>
<li>Callbacks, extremely extensively</li>
<li>Some validations - but just to make sure I coded them right. See more of this perspective in <a href="http://www.christopherbloom.com/2011/07/12/testing-model-validations-in-rspec-the-short-and-sweet-way/">Testing model validations in rspec the short and sweet way</a></li>
</ul>


<p>... and for now, that's about it.</p>

<h2>Regarding generating fake data</h2>

<p>Like I mentioned before, I do use FactoryGirl extensively. Maybe that means that <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-07-14-why-i-don-t-like-factory_girl">my models are complicated</a>? I don't know, but for now, I am sort of using good sense and stuff. Let's see what happens. I do use <a href="http://faker.rubyforge.org">Faker</a> as well. Come to think about it, will do a post on that eventually.</p>

<h2>Random issues in testing models</h2>

<p>When everything seems to be absolutely correct in the models and in the tests and you are still getting unexplainable errors, do restart guard. I already spent several hours messing around with the tests because guard didn't refresh the models. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5855587/spork-is-really-great-but-how-can-i-get-it-to-refresh-validations-and-other-cod">There are automatic solutions</a>, but I didn't feel like hacking away the spork/guard configurations again... yet.</p>

<h2>Random resources</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://everydayrails.com/2012/03/19/testing-series-rspec-models-factory-girl.html">Everyday Rails: How I learned to test my Rails applications, Part 3: Model specs</a> - this has a very nice overview of the actual steps required to test models. Now I just cheat using shoulda, but it's very nice and useful to get a</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.christopherbloom.com/2011/07/12/testing-model-validations-in-rspec-the-short-and-sweet-way/">Testing model validations in rspec the short and sweet way</a> - it's a bit outdated, but describes how to test validations in a short way.</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>Again, as I already mentioned, I am a beginner to rails and, consequently, in testing rails, so I might be doing/saying terribly wrong things. Any input is very much appreciated :-)</p>

    <link href="http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/14/how-i-test/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-14T11:43:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/14/how-i-test</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not that I am an authority in testing... this is just a compilation of the so-called "best practices" that I've been seeing around, as well as some extra tips from my (very limited) experience. I'd love to hear the feedback from more experienced people... I'm going to do several of these as I go along.</p>

<h2>Gems I use</h2>

<p>I test using <a href="http://rspec.info">rspec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">shoulda</a>, which dramatically reduces the size of the tests. But beware -- rspec is a DSL, and I think that I only got a bit more intuition on what I was exactly testing after doing some tests in Test::Unit. I also use <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">FactoryGirl</a> for setting up the test data, instead of fixtures. Last but not least, the <a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov">simplecov</a> gem is amazing, and although you shouldn't rely on it to determine when to stop testing, it really is good to get a (very precise) sense of what's covered and what's not in their beautiful html reports.</p>

<h2>General tips</h2>

<p>When all your tests are red for no apparent reason, it's because you were messing around with the db and then forgot to do</p>

<pre><code>rake db:test:clone</code></pre>


<p>Yup, the reason I am mentioning it here even though it seems completely obvious is because I am distracted and do that a lot... :-)</p>

<h2>Tips for running guard/spork in vagrant</h2>

<p>I use vagrant to keep my environment all neatly in one place. However, there are downsides. When running guard inside the guest OS, use</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec guard -p</code></pre>


<p>Otherwise, guard won't detect changes in the guest filesystem.</p>

<h2>FactoryGirl tips</h2>

<p>You can keep all factories in one file, for me that is more intuitive (and also, I don't have to keep opening files while I'm testing, it's all in one place.)</p>

<p>To try FactoryGirl methods in the console, run:</p>

<pre><code>FactoryGirl.find_definitions</code></pre>


<p>At least in my case, I would get a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8409787/factorygirl-factory-not-registered-user-argumenterror">factory not registered</a> error when I didn't do that.</p>

<h2>Better Errors</h2>

<p>Not exactly related to testing, but <a href="https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors">this gem</a> has been a life changer! When there is an error, the standard error page gets replaced by a much better and useful error page, which has a full trace, the local and instance variables that are set at the time, and a terminal that you can use to inspect and make changes to the variables in the models and controllers in real time (or code whatever you want). I know I already mentioned it in another post, but I can't stress enough how cool this gem is!</p>

<p>In the next posts, I'll give an overview of how I test the models and controllers, which I only started testing this week!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I usually have Guard running in the background with Spork, but when I'm writing tests I like to do it the old fashioned way and be able to do rspec some_test | less. The problem with that approach is that we get a monochrome version of our tests. In order to redirect the color in the pipe, edit spec_helper and add the following:</p>

<pre><code> # spec/spec_helper.rb
Rspec.configure do |config|
    config.tty = true
    config.color_enabled = true
    # ... whatever configurations you might have here...
end

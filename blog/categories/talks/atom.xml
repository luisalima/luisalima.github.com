    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For anyone who works in business (especially startups), this is most probably (or most definitely) the most important TED talk that you'll ever get to watch. Or the most important talk/piece of advice that you'll ever get, I believe.</p>

<p>People buy what you believe in. Somehow this makes me believe in mankind a bit more :-)</p>

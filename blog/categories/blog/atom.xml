    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I created this blog specifically to jot down notes of interesting / useful / meaningful stuff I find during my adventures with development, which I hope are useful to others.</p>

<p>And to start with, here is a link to a post that really helped me out <a href="http://code.dblock.org/octopress-setting-up-a-blog-and-contributing-to-an-existing-one">Octopress: Setting up a Blog and Contributing to an Existing One</a>. It wasn't really clear to me from Octopress instructions that I had to run rake generate and rake deploy; I was just trying to make the git commits and push by hand (and becoming really frustrated by it). So, just for my own reference:</p>

<pre><code>
    # do stuff in your blog, like rake new_post
    # then generate the blog
    rake generate
    # then save the source branch and push it to Github
    git add .
    git commit -m "whatever message"
    git push origin source
    # and now, this is where the magic happens! this takes care
    # of pushing everything automagically onto the master branch!
    rake deploy
</code></pre>


<p>(depending on your system, you might need to run bundle exec followed by the rake commands).</p>

<p>Ta-da!</p>

<p>So far I'm really enjoying Octopress -- I chose it because I want to be able to do everything from the shell, and never leave my dev environment and my beloved ST2/emacs combination.</p>

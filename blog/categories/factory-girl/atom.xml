    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The guys at Thoughtbot do an excellent job. I especially love shoulda and high_voltage. I have a love/hate relationship with factory_girl, so I decided to write this post trying to detail some of the ways I've been using it. Maybe it will help someone. Hope it does!</p>

<p>First of all, what is a factory and what do you need it for? Factories are a (healthier) alternative to fixtures, and fixtures are simply a "fixed state" for models, used as baseline for tests. In Rails, fixtures get automatically loaded into the test database before tests are run, and you define them in a YAML file. However, they can become awkward pretty easily, so Factories were created -- frameworks designed to allow a quick creation of fully featured objects for testing.</p>

<p>And now you ask, why don't we just create the object directly before each test? Think required attributes and associations -- if your model has 10 attributes and 5 different associations you might want to have somewhere where you can create valid instances of that model upfront and then reuse them.</p>

<p>So, we have (somewhat) established what factories are for. <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-07-14-why-i-don-t-like-factory_girl">Just beware of the downsides of using factories</a> (quoting the blog in the link, which is highly recommended):
"A big feature of tests is to give you feedback on your code. Tests and code have a symbiotic relationship. Your tests inform your code. If a test is complicated, your code is complicated. Ultimately, because tests are a client of your code, you can see how easy or hard your code's interfaces are."</p>

<p>Yup, I feel your pain, bro. My latest project has tons of models, polymorphic interfaces, STI's, etc. Ultimately, flexibility creates complexity, and it's better to avoid extra features to keep simplicity. But I digress.</p>

<p>So, how do we use these lil' bastards? :-)</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md">Getting started</a> guide provides what you need. Except... I don't think it's that clear that if you are using Rspec, those lines</p>

<pre><code>
    require 'factory_girl'
    FactoryGirl.find_definitions
</code></pre>


<p>go in the spec_helper.rb file. More precisely, <em>FactoryGirl.find_definitions</em> goes inside the <em>RSpec.configure do |config|</em> block.</p>

<p><em>But:</em> if you are using Spork, you need to reload Factory definitions at each run, otherwise you get a "factory not registered" error. So, place the following inside the <em>Spork.each_run do</em> block:</p>

<pre><code>
    Spork.each_run do
    # ....
        FactoryGirl.definition_file_paths << File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'factories')
      FactoryGirl.find_definitions
    # etc...
</code></pre>


<p>There you go! Everything nicely configured :-) Also, you can use FactoryGirl in rails console! Just use the code <a href="http://blog.thefrontiergroup.com.au/2011/03/reloading-factory-girl-factories-in-the-rails-3-console/">in this post</a>, which I'll shamelessly copy here for posterity and for my own reference:</p>

<pre><code>
    ActionDispatch::Callbacks.after do
      # Reload the factories
      return unless (Rails.env.development? || Rails.env.test?)

      unless FactoryGirl.factories.blank? # first init will load factories, this should only run on subsequent reloads
        FactoryGirl.factories.clear
        FactoryGirl.find_definitions
      end
    end
</code></pre>


<p>You can also just run this code directly in the console. If you do have sequences defined, you'll need to add the following extra:</p>

<pre><code>
FactoryGirl.factories.clear
FactoryGirl.sequences.clear
FactoryGirl.find_definitions
</code></pre>


<p>(and if you are using <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/23673635798/remove-duplication-with-factorygirls-traits">traits</a>, apparently you need to add FactoryGirl.traits.clear as well).</p>

<h2>In unit testing</h2>

<p>So first things first... You can have a file for testing factories but I'd rather have the test for the validity of the factory in the model test file itself -- this to avoid incurring errors when you are focusing on testing a particular model, all because your factory was ill-defined. So go ahead and test the factory itself:</p>

<pre><code>
    it "has a valid factory" do
        m = FactoryGirl.build(:my_model)
        m.should be_valid
    end
</code></pre>


<p>What do we do if this goes wrong and we can't sort out the error? Go to the console, write</p>

<pre><code>
m = FactoryGirl.build(:my_model)
m.valid?  # duh, it'll be false
m.save    # just to trigger all validations callbacks etc that we might have
m.errors
</code></pre>


<p>And now go ahead and complete your factory with the necessary information. Simple enough, right? The syntax for defining factories is explained pretty well <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md">in the starting guide</a> so I won't go to the trouble, except for the case when we are using Faker.</p>

<h2>With Faker</h2>

<p>Faker is a cool gem for... you guessed it, generating fake data. And here's how you do it:</p>

<pre><code>
  factory :company do
    name { Faker::Company.name }
    phone {Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone}
  end
</code></pre>


<p>Yup, just a normal block, not too bad.</p>

<h2>Sequences</h2>

<p>Sequences are used for attributes that must be unique, such as email addresses. You can define sequences "outside" of the factory definition, or inside as a block:</p>

<pre><code>
  sequence :email do |n|
    "test#{n}@example.com"
  end

    factory :user do
        email
    password "password"
    password_confirmation "password"
    phone {Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone}
    end
</code></pre>


<p>is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>
    factory :user do
        sequence(:email) { |n| "test#{n}@example.com"}
    password "password"
    password_confirmation "password"
    phone {Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone}
    end
</code></pre>


<h2>Associations</h2>

<p>Associations in factories are simply created by adding the factory name for the association in the other factory block. For example, if my user has_one location:</p>

<pre><code>
    factory :user do
        sequence(:email) { |n| "test#{n}@example.com"}
    password "password"
    password_confirmation "password"
    phone {Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone}
    location   # ta-da!
    end
</code></pre>

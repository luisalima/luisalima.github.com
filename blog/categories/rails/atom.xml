    <id>http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2013/01/04/random-notes-on-factory-girl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The guys at Thoughtbot do an excellent job. I especially love shoulda and high_voltage. I have a love/hate relationship with factory_girl, so I decided to write this post trying to detail some of the ways I've been using it. Maybe it will help someone. Hope it does!</p>

<p>First of all, what is a factory and what do you need it for? Factories are a (healthier) alternative to fixtures, and fixtures are simply a "fixed state" for models, used as baseline for tests. In Rails, fixtures get automatically loaded into the test database before tests are run, and you define them in a YAML file. However, they can become awkward pretty easily, so Factories were created -- frameworks designed to allow a quick creation of fully featured objects for testing.</p>

<p>And now you ask, why don't we just create the object directly before each test? Think required attributes and associations -- if your model has 10 attributes and 5 different associations you might want to have somewhere where you can create valid instances of that model upfront and then reuse them.</p>

<p>So, we have (somewhat) established what factories are for. <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-07-14-why-i-don-t-like-factory_girl">Just beware of the downsides of using factories</a> (quoting the blog in the link, which is highly recommended):
"A big feature of tests is to give you feedback on your code. Tests and code have a symbiotic relationship. Your tests inform your code. If a test is complicated, your code is complicated. Ultimately, because tests are a client of your code, you can see how easy or hard your code's interfaces are."</p>

<p>Yup, I feel your pain, bro. My latest project has tons of models, polymorphic interfaces, STI's, etc. Ultimately, flexibility creates complexity, and it's better to avoid extra features to keep simplicity. But I digress.</p>

<p>So, how do we use these lil' bastards? :-)</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md">Getting started</a> guide provides what you need. Except... I don't think it's that clear that if you are using Rspec, those lines</p>

<pre><code>
    require 'factory_girl'
    FactoryGirl.find_definitions
</code></pre>


<p>go in the spec_helper.rb file. More precisely, <em>FactoryGirl.find_definitions</em> goes inside the <em>RSpec.configure do |config|</em> block.</p>

<p><em>But:</em> if you are using Spork, you need to reload Factory definitions at each run, otherwise you get a "factory not registered" error. So, place the following inside the <em>Spork.each_run do</em> block:</p>

<pre><code>
    Spork.each_run do
    # ....
        FactoryGirl.definition_file_paths << File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'factories')
      FactoryGirl.find_definitions
    # etc...
</code></pre>


<p>There you go! Everything nicely configured :-) Also, you can use FactoryGirl in rails console! Just use the code <a href="http://blog.thefrontiergroup.com.au/2011/03/reloading-factory-girl-factories-in-the-rails-3-console/">in this post</a>, which I'll shamelessly copy here for posterity and for my own reference:</p>

<pre><code>
    ActionDispatch::Callbacks.after do
      # Reload the factories
      return unless (Rails.env.development? || Rails.env.test?)

      unless FactoryGirl.factories.blank? # first init will load factories, this should only run on subsequent reloads
        FactoryGirl.factories.clear
        FactoryGirl.find_definitions
      end
    end
</code></pre>


<p>You can also just run this code directly in the console. If you do have sequences defined, you'll need to add the following extra:</p>

<pre><code>
FactoryGirl.factories.clear
FactoryGirl.sequences.clear
FactoryGirl.find_definitions
</code></pre>


<p>(and if you are using <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/23673635798/remove-duplication-with-factorygirls-traits">traits</a>, apparently you need to add FactoryGirl.traits.clear as well).</p>

<h2>In unit testing</h2>

<p>So first things first... You can have a file for testing factories but I'd rather have the test for the validity of the factory in the model test file itself -- this to avoid incurring errors when you are focusing on testing a particular model, all because your factory was ill-defined. So go ahead and test the factory itself:</p>

<pre><code>
    it "has a valid factory" do
        m = FactoryGirl.build(:my_model)
        m.should be_valid
    end
</code></pre>


<p>What do we do if this goes wrong and we can't sort out the error? Go to the console, write</p>

<pre><code>
m = FactoryGirl.build(:my_model)
m.valid?  # duh, it'll be false
m.save    # just to trigger all validations callbacks etc that we might have
m.errors
</code></pre>


<p>And now go ahead and complete your factory with the necessary information. Simple enough, right? The syntax for defining factories is explained pretty well <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md">in the starting guide</a> so I won't go to the trouble, except for the case when we are using Faker.</p>

<h2>With Faker</h2>

<p>Faker is a cool gem for... you guessed it, generating fake data. And here's how you do it:</p>

<pre><code>
  factory :company do
    name { Faker::Company.name }
    phone {Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone}
  end
</code></pre>


<p>Yup, just a normal block, not too bad.</p>

<h2>Sequences</h2>

<p>Sequences are used for attributes that must be unique, such as email addresses. You can define sequences "outside" of the factory definition, or inside as a block:</p>

<pre><code>
  sequence :email do |n|
    "test#{n}@example.com"
  end

    factory :user do
        email
    password "password"
    password_confirmation "password"
    phone {Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone}
    end
</code></pre>


<p>is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>
    factory :user do
        sequence(:email) { |n| "test#{n}@example.com"}
    password "password"
    password_confirmation "password"
    phone {Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone}
    end
</code></pre>


<h2>Associations</h2>

<p>Associations in factories are simply created by adding the factory name for the association in the other factory block. For example, if my user has_one location:</p>

<pre><code>
    factory :user do
        sequence(:email) { |n| "test#{n}@example.com"}
    password "password"
    password_confirmation "password"
    phone {Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone}
    location   # ta-da!
    end
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/20/intriguing-behavior/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-20T20:15:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/20/intriguing-behavior</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, for those who don't know it (I just discovered about it), if you want to validate the presence of a boolean field, you can't do it with validates_presence_of.</p>

<p>So, suppose that we have a model like</p>

<pre><code>
# == Schema Information
# Table name: Bla
#  test       :boolean
class Bla < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :test
</code></pre>


<p>For example, if I had used validates_presence_of :test in the example above, it would have failed miserably because false.blank? is true -- so in practice, we could have never set bla.test to false, since it would make the validation fail (<a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Validations/ClassMethods/validates_presence_of">more details here</a>).</p>

<p>So I set out to try this out:</p>

<pre><code>
validates_inclusion_of :test, :in => [true, false]
</code></pre>


<p>and test it like this:</p>

<pre><code>
it {should_not allow_value("bla").for(:completed)}
</code></pre>


<p>and it still failed miserably.</p>

<p>Now I was puzzled... So I tried this one out:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4348179.js?file=bla.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># == Schema Information
#
# Table name: Bla
#  test       :boolean

class Bla &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :test
  before_validation :test_present
  def test_present
  	puts &quot;TEST PRESENT&quot;
  	puts self.test
  	errors.add(:test, &quot;Must be set to true or false&quot;) if !([true, false].include?(self.test))
  end
  
# Same behavior with validate, before_save, before_validation:
b = Bla.new
b.test = &quot;bla&quot;
b.save
# prints
# TEST PRESENT
# false

# found out about this while testing
# 	it {should_not allow_value(:other).for(:completed)}
# I know that I don't need to test that the boolean will be true or false, the db does it for me...
# but I'm wondering... does the test attribute ever get to be &quot;bla&quot;?
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>I was thinking that at some point the test attribute would be set to "bla", but since the field is a boolean, inserting other values will always evaluate to false. So we don't have to go to all this trouble: this way we can validate the presence, but we never need to validate whether the value itself is valid.

    <link href="http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/20/how-i-test-part-iii/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-20T16:48:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/20/how-i-test-part-iii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why RSpec? That is a good question. My main reason for using RSpec right now is because I want to have a testing + documentation + TODO bundle, all in one, like a shampoo:</p>

<ul>
<li>testing -- ok, RSpec does make things a tad more complicated for testing. I believe that testing actually makes you learn more about what you code, and RSpec, being a DSL, can make things esoteric enough that sometimes you don't know exactly what you're testing (I confess that I like Test::Unit more because it's simpler for developers to read -- assert that this gives this result). But, on the other hand, you have shoulda! :-)</li>
<li>documentation -- the exact same thing that makes testing a bit more esoteric, makes documentation a piece of cake. You want to know how something works? Just read the tests. And RSpec does make that side of testing much clearer.</li>
<li>TODO -- yup, that's right. If you have features that you want to implement later on, just add a "pending" spec with the description of what you want to do. Of course that you can do that in Test::Unit as well, but it's not as beautiful and immediate as in RSpec.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course that I'm really just beginning and I might change my mind eventually. <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/dhh-offended-by-rspec-debate-4610.html">Even the creator of Rails argues against RSPec</a>, and there are quite a few arguments against it (if you missed the link, here's an <a href="http://objectreload.com/articles/2010/09/thoughts-on-testing-part-1.html">excellent blog post on that</a>).</p>

<p>By the way, I'm abiding by this rule from the last post:</p>

<p>"- Keep things flat — deeply nested contexts are ugly as they hinder readability of your test cases. Split your tests up into different files if they’re getting too long."</p>

<p>I was trying to make things DRY in the tests, and then I thought... why bother, exactly? It's better if they are more readable, for the sake of documentation as stated above. Amen, brothers.</p>

<h2>Why not Cucumber for request specs?</h2>

<p>All the reasons are in this <a href="http://epimetrics.com/entries/3129">excellent post</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/19/how-i-test-part-ii/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-19T10:17:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://luisalima.github.com/blog/2012/12/19/how-i-test-part-ii</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Testing models</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html">rails guides</a>:</p>

<p>"Ideally, you would like to include a test for everything which could possibly break. It’s a good practice to have at least one test for each of your validations and at least one test for every method in your model."</p>

<p>Which leads me to...</p>

<h2>Why I use shoulda</h2>

<p>I think that the best thing is just to take a peek at <a href="http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/rspec_shoulda/">The shoulda cheat sheets</a>.</p>

<p>You actually get a guide of what to test by looking at the cheat sheet! It's too bad that it's not up to date (actually I think that the whole site is not up to date -- even the gem doesn't work anymore, which I think is too bad :-( )</p>

<p>Furthermore, it's great for lazy people and it's definitely easier on the eyes. Just check the following example:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4339197.js?file=shoulda_model.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># without shoulda... tons of code :-)
it &quot;should belong to person&quot; do
	Model.reflect_on_association(:person).macro.should == :belongs_to
end

# with shoulda... one-liner!
it{should belong_to(:person)}
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Convinced? ;-)</p>

<h2>What I test exactly with shoulda</h2>

<p>I go through the whole list of shoulda macros for models, and I just use and abuse them. Since the cheat sheet is not up to date, I created a new one (just for models for now) at:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4339490.js?file=shoulda_cheat_model.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># updated from the original @ http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/rspec_shoulda
# just a subset -- models -- is included here. I'll update this, and create cheat sheets for others, as I go along.
# I marked the ones I added with NEW and also added the links to the corresponding code, as I think it's useful.

</p>

<p>Yes, it's a bit tedious. But (1) you make sure that you are actually testing all these details, which is extremely useful when you are constantly refactoring your code, and (2) it's not that slow with the multiple cursors of Sublime Text 2. You just need to have a scaffold.</p>

<h2>What I test without shoulda</h2>

<p>Apart from model methods, is there that much to test without shoulda? I test:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any model methods, extensively</li>
<li>Callbacks, extremely extensively</li>
<li>Some validations - but just to make sure I coded them right. See more of this perspective in <a href="http://www.christopherbloom.com/2011/07/12/testing-model-validations-in-rspec-the-short-and-sweet-way/">Testing model validations in rspec the short and sweet way</a></li>
</ul>


<p>... and for now, that's about it.</p>

<h2>Regarding generating fake data</h2>

<p>Like I mentioned before, I do use FactoryGirl extensively. Maybe that means that <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-07-14-why-i-don-t-like-factory_girl">my models are complicated</a>? I don't know, but for now, I am sort of using good sense and stuff. Let's see what happens. I do use <a href="http://faker.rubyforge.org">Faker</a> as well. Come to think about it, will do a post on that eventually.</p>

<h2>Random issues in testing models</h2>

<p>When everything seems to be absolutely correct in the models and in the tests and you are still getting unexplainable errors, do restart guard. I already spent several hours messing around with the tests because guard didn't refresh the models. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5855587/spork-is-really-great-but-how-can-i-get-it-to-refresh-validations-and-other-cod">There are automatic solutions</a>, but I didn't feel like hacking away the spork/guard configurations again... yet.</p>

<h2>Random resources</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://everydayrails.com/2012/03/19/testing-series-rspec-models-factory-girl.html">Everyday Rails: How I learned to test my Rails applications, Part 3: Model specs</a> - this has a very nice overview of the actual steps required to test models. Now I just cheat using shoulda, but it's very nice and useful to get a</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.christopherbloom.com/2011/07/12/testing-model-validations-in-rspec-the-short-and-sweet-way/">Testing model validations in rspec the short and sweet way</a> - it's a bit outdated, but describes how to test validations in a short way.</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>Again, as I already mentioned, I am a beginner to rails and, consequently, in testing rails, so I might be doing/saying terribly wrong things. Any input is very much appreciated :-)</p>

	<h2 class="title">Good & Somewhat Random but Focused Advice for Programmers</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>First, the non-technical one: <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Don&#8217;t call yourself a programmer, and other career advice, by Patrick from Kalzumeus</a>. Although it does seem to me that some of this advice has changed very recently due to the lack of people in the field (somehow there is somewhat of a mystique about being a programmer right now, don&#8217;t you think?), the article is amazing and is filled with great advice. And it&#8217;s also filled with very funny observations about academia&#8230; Spoiler alert: &#8220;(After youâ€™ve escaped the mind-warping miasma of academia, you might rightfully question whether Published In A Journal is really personally or societally significant as opposed to close approximations like Wrote A Blog Post And Showed It To Smart People.)&#8221;. Yup, been wondering about that myself.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">this is scary</a>. I wonder whether this is really true? I think that all the developers I know would pass the FizzBuzz test. Now I feel very much tempted to have my students code this in the next lesson&#8230; Mmmmmhmmmm&#8230;</p>

<p>On the same lines, from the creator of Rails himself, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3375-the-five-programming-books-that-meant-most-to-me">here is a short list of (5) books</a> that help you program better. I think I&#8217;m going to order some of those. Probably the Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns. Look, <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~black/OOP/slides/Best%20Practice%20I.pdf">here is an amazing set of slides based on the book to help me make up my mind</a>: &#8220;Remember: the purpose of education is to save you from having to think&#8221; ROFL!</p>

<p>Yes, 70% of the time is spent on finding the intent of other programmers. And that&#8217;s probably because we don&#8217;t read enough code, because it&#8217;s more fun to just jump ahead at the problem and play with code than to try to figure out how things are done (guilty&#8230;). Along those lines, <a href="http://blog.mojotech.com/post/38317154050/code-with-clarity">here is a cool article on &#8220;Code with Clarity&#8221;</a>, where you have a step-by-step deconstruction of a very small function. And somewhat along those lines as well, <a href="http://rubysource.com/cracking-gems-reading-ruby-code/">here is a cool article on cracking gems and reading ruby code</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, lately I have met programmers that fit into two sets: the first set is the linux hacker set. These guys are extremely fluent in all things linux-y and could probably code a whole OS in shell scripting. The second set tends to stay away from the shell like it&#8217;s the devil, they love IDEs, and think that man pages are ugly. So here is a little something for the second set: <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/essential-command-line-tools-for-web-developers/">essential command line tools for web developers</a> (and not just web developers). Terribly useful to know your way around a shell, you&#8217;ll need it someday.</p>

<p>And I think that&#8217;s it for the day. Now on to read &amp; write some code&#8230;</p>

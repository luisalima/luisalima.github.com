			Good & Somewhat Random but Focused Advice for Programmers</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>First, the non-technical one: <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/">Don&#8217;t call yourself a programmer, and other career advice, by Patrick from Kalzumeus</a>. Although it does seem to me that some of this advice has changed very recently due to the lack of people in the field (somehow there is somewhat of a mystique about being a programmer right now, don&#8217;t you think?), the article is amazing and is filled with great advice. And it&#8217;s also filled with very funny observations about academia&#8230; Spoiler alert: &#8220;(After youâ€™ve escaped the mind-warping miasma of academia, you might rightfully question whether Published In A Journal is really personally or societally significant as opposed to close approximations like Wrote A Blog Post And Showed It To Smart People.)&#8221;. Yup, been wondering about that myself.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">this is scary</a>. I wonder whether this is really true? I think that all the developers I know would pass the FizzBuzz test. Now I feel very much tempted to have my students code this in the next lesson&#8230; Mmmmmhmmmm&#8230;</p>

<p>On the same lines, from the creator of Rails himself, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3375-the-five-programming-books-that-meant-most-to-me">here is a short list of (5) books</a> that help you program better. I think I&#8217;m going to order some of those. Probably the Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns. Look, <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~black/OOP/slides/Best%20Practice%20I.pdf">here is an amazing set of slides based on the book to help me make up my mind</a>: &#8220;Remember: the purpose of education is to save you from having to think&#8221; ROFL!</p>

<p>Yes, 70% of the time is spent on finding the intent of other programmers. And that&#8217;s probably because we don&#8217;t read enough code, because it&#8217;s more fun to just jump ahead at the problem and play with code than to try to figure out how things are done (guilty&#8230;). Along those lines, <a href="http://blog.mojotech.com/post/38317154050/code-with-clarity">here is a cool article on &#8220;Code with Clarity&#8221;</a>, where you have a step-by-step deconstruction of a very small function. And somewhat along those lines as well, <a href="http://rubysource.com/cracking-gems-reading-ruby-code/">here is a cool article on cracking gems and reading ruby code</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, lately I have met programmers that fit into two sets: the first set is the linux hacker set. These guys are extremely fluent in all things linux-y and could probably code a whole OS in shell scripting. The second set tends to stay away from the shell like it&#8217;s the devil, they love IDEs, and think that man pages are ugly. So here is a little something for the second set: <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/essential-command-line-tools-for-web-developers/">essential command line tools for web developers</a> (and not just web developers). Terribly useful to know your way around a shell, you&#8217;ll need it someday.</p>

<p>And I think that&#8217;s it for the day. Now on to read &amp; write some code&#8230;</p>

			Raspberry Pi GPIO for Beginners</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Me and my boyfriend offered his father (an amateur electronics afficcionado) this Christmas the best gift ever (we think) &#8211; a Raspberry Pi!</p>

<p>But now I&#8217;ve been struggling with finding some true beginner tutorials for people who are new to Linux, don&#8217;t know that much English, and have an interest on using the Pi for more advanced controller stuff. So here is the list that I found so far &#8211; I&#8217;ll be adding more links as time comes (and possibly translating some stuff to Portuguese, so if you are interested in that, stay tuned)!</p>

<h2>From Adafruit learning system</h2>

<p>They have extremely nice (I mean <em>extremely</em> nice) step-by-step tutorials, exactly with the focus I wanted. Just <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/search?q=raspberry">perform a search by &#8220;raspberry&#8221; on their site</a> and you&#8217;ll find:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-gpio">GPIO setup on the Raspberry Pi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-e-mail-notifier-using-leds">Raspberry Pi E-mail notifier using LEDs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi">Reading analog inputs with the Raspberry Pi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/playing-sounds-and-using-buttons-with-raspberry-pi">Playing sounds and using buttons with the Raspberry Pi</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Other sources</h2>

<p>This <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2953">video tutorial from Geek Gurl Diaries</a> is also pretty neat to learn something more.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be doing some of these projects myself and translating them to PT as I have the time. My ultimate goal is to be able to control the lights and blinders in my house with the Pi and to do some sort of home automation smarts but for now, I think I&#8217;ll stick to LEDs and not to 220V stuff :-) I also want to do some sort of intrusion detection system. Stay tuned!</p>

			Random Cool Links</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>An assortment of random cool links I&#8217;ve been gathering during the holiday break (even in my glorious horsey days in Alentejo).</p>

<h2>Iphone and app stuffs</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.brewster.com">This app</a>, if it lives up to its promises, has everything that I&#8217;ve been wishing for and more. Basically, it&#8217;s a smarter contact manager that can aggregate not only contacts from your contact list, but also from social networks, it keeps track of how much you communicate with your contacts, spots trends, can create smart lists and take advantage of the information that you have in social networks to perform smarter searches. The interface is pretty awesome as well. My only complaint is that for now, I cannot add my Facebook contacts. When I do it, it completely resets the settings in the app (that&#8217;s the iphone app). Maybe that&#8217;s just a problem with my particular system, but I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing this working in my iphone, ipad (app hasn&#8217;t been released yet) and desktop (ahhh&#8230; automatic lists for sending e-mails in Xmas)!</p></li>
<li><p>If your iphone home button is unresponsive (mine becomes from time to time, randomly so), <a href="http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57524891-285/four-ways-to-fix-an-unresponsive-iphone-home-button/">here are four ways to fix it by our friends at c|net</a>.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Web development tutorials and stuffs</h2>

<p><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/what-was-hot-in-2012-month-by-month/">This link</a> has an assortment of the &#8220;best&#8221; nettuts tutorials, released month by month. The most interesting for me seem to be the &#8220;learn jQuery in 30 days&#8221;, closures with javascript, mobile-first responsive web design, javascript design patterns, and gem creation with bundler. For those that want to know more about topics such as agile development and vagrant (highly recommended) there&#8217;s something for every taste as well! I&#8217;ve been procrastinating learning more on frontend development because I find the backend problems way more interesting&#8230; I hope to follow these tutorials to learn more about these topics.</p>

<h2>Fourier transform</h2>

<p>Yup, I wish I had taken a signal processing class during undergrad. But I didn&#8217;t. And this <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/">interactive guide to the Fourier transform</a> is a lovely start for those like me who didn&#8217;t have the wisdom to figure out the stuff that they needed on their own during undergrad. Amazing explanation!</p>

<h2>Three Crowdsourcing Projects that are Advancing the Medical Field</h2>

<p>I really really believe in the power of crowdsourcing for advancing our knowledge of medicine and of the human body. Medicine as it is practiced nowadays seems so&#8230; retrogad. As a friend of mine put it, the best doctors for ourselves are ourselves. There are so many things that doctors just cannot know, so many new weird conditions&#8230; So why not harness the power of the people? That&#8217;s what <a href="http://dailycrowdsource.com/crowdsourcing/projects/1059-3-crowdsourcing-projects-that-are-advancing-the-medical-field">these crowdsourcing projects</a> aim to to.</p>

<h2>Security random stuffs</h2>

<p>A very <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/computing/software/computers-its-time-to-start-over">cool article/podcast</a> interviewing Robert Watson about the shifts in computer security, especially from an OS security and exploits point of view.</p>

<p>An app that attempts to mitigate the side effects of these problems (such as accessing the data in your phone) is <a href="http://www.remotium.com">remotium</a>, where a good friend of mine (JosÃ© LuÃ­s Pereira) is working. Do check it out &#8211; they have a cool video of an android exploit being performed live.</p>

<h2>Clipboard buffering for OS X</h2>

<p>How can you live without it?</p>

<p>I chose <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12">flycut</a>, which is based on <a href="http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net">jumpcut</a> but seems to be updated more often (as we can see by the choice of github and not sourceforge :-) ). Highly recommended, you&#8217;ll never know how you could live without it.</p>

<h2>Really assorted links</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>One topic that really comes to my mind often, especially now that I teach at the University, is how much college is worth exactly. <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/siliconValleyIsWrongAboutCollege">This article</a> gives a nice blunt opinion on why college still matters (but to be honest, I do think that we should not go straight to college out of high school &#8211; not because we don&#8217;t know what we want exactly, but also because we don&#8217;t know how to appreciate and select the most important topics for us to focus on. I view my undergraduate experience completely differently as of today!).</p></li>
<li><p>Another proof that only execution matters is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jjcolao/2012/10/15/hounded-by-recruiters-coders-put-themselves-up-for-auction/">DeveloperAuction</a>. I had something similar to this idea years ago&#8230; but of course, never executed on it, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that I would be any successful if I tried ;-) The article is very interesting. The &#8220;world&#8221; is very different for developers engineers in the US!</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Call for help</h2>

<p>If anyoone has any idea of why the code in my gists appears centered and not nicely indented as nature intended it to be, please let me know. I am using Octopress and Slash, and the gists are stored in Github (where they do indeed appear nicely indented).</p>

			Intriguing Behavior: Validating Presence of a Boolean Field</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So, for those who don&#8217;t know it (I just discovered about it), if you want to validate the presence of a boolean field, you can&#8217;t do it with validates_presence_of.</p>

<p>So, suppose that we have a model like</p>

<pre><code>
# == Schema Information
# Table name: Bla
#  test       :boolean
class Bla < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :test
</code></pre>


<p>For example, if I had used validates_presence_of :test in the example above, it would have failed miserably because false.blank? is true &#8211; so in practice, we could have never set bla.test to false, since it would make the validation fail (<a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Validations/ClassMethods/validates_presence_of">more details here</a>).</p>

<p>So I set out to try this out:</p>

<pre><code>
validates_inclusion_of :test, :in => [true, false]
</code></pre>


<p>and test it like this:</p>

<pre><code>
it {should_not allow_value("bla").for(:completed)}
</code></pre>


<p>and it still failed miserably.</p>

<p>Now I was puzzled&#8230; So I tried this one out:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4348179.js?file=bla.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># == Schema Information
#
# Table name: Bla
#  test       :boolean

class Bla &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :test
  before_validation :test_present
  def test_present
    puts &quot;TEST PRESENT&quot;
    puts self.test
    errors.add(:test, &quot;Must be set to true or false&quot;) if !([true, false].include?(self.test))
  end
  
# Same behavior with validate, before_save, before_validation:
b = Bla.new
b.test = &quot;bla&quot;
b.save
# prints
# TEST PRESENT
# false

# found out about this while testing
#   it {should_not allow_value(:other).for(:completed)}
# I know that I don't need to test that the boolean will be true or false, the db does it for me...
# but I'm wondering... does the test attribute ever get to be &quot;bla&quot;?
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I was thinking that at some point the test attribute would be set to &#8220;bla&#8221;, but since the field is a boolean, inserting other values will always evaluate to false. So we don&#8217;t have to go to all this trouble: this way we can validate the presence, but we never need to validate whether the value itself is valid. More about this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5170008/rails-validating-inclusion-of-a-boolean-fails-tests/5171074#5171074">here</a>. Living and learning!</p>

			How I Test Part III: Why Rspec?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Why RSpec? That is a good question. My main reason for using RSpec right now is because I want to have a testing + documentation + TODO bundle, all in one, like a shampoo:</p>

<ul>
<li>testing &#8211; ok, RSpec does make things a tad more complicated for testing. I believe that testing actually makes you learn more about what you code, and RSpec, being a DSL, can make things esoteric enough that sometimes you don&#8217;t know exactly what you&#8217;re testing (I confess that I like Test::Unit more because it&#8217;s simpler for developers to read &#8211; assert that this gives this result). But, on the other hand, you have shoulda! :-)</li>
<li>documentation &#8211; the exact same thing that makes testing a bit more esoteric, makes documentation a piece of cake. You want to know how something works? Just read the tests. And RSpec does make that side of testing much clearer.</li>
<li>TODO &#8211; yup, that&#8217;s right. If you have features that you want to implement later on, just add a &#8220;pending&#8221; spec with the description of what you want to do. Of course that you can do that in Test::Unit as well, but it&#8217;s not as beautiful and immediate as in RSpec.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course that I&#8217;m really just beginning and I might change my mind eventually. <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/dhh-offended-by-rspec-debate-4610.html">Even the creator of Rails argues against RSPec</a>, and there are quite a few arguments against it (if you missed the link, here&#8217;s an <a href="http://objectreload.com/articles/2010/09/thoughts-on-testing-part-1.html">excellent blog post on that</a>).</p>

<p>By the way, I&#8217;m abiding by this rule from the last post:</p>

<p>&#8221;- Keep things flat â€” deeply nested contexts are ugly as they hinder readability of your test cases. Split your tests up into different files if theyâ€™re getting too long.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was trying to make things DRY in the tests, and then I thought&#8230; why bother, exactly? It&#8217;s better if they are more readable, for the sake of documentation as stated above. Amen, brothers.</p>

<h2>Why not Cucumber for request specs?</h2>

<p>All the reasons are in this <a href="http://epimetrics.com/entries/3129">excellent post</a>.</p>

			How I Test Part II - Testing Models</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Testing models</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html">rails guides</a>:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ideally, you would like to include a test for everything which could possibly break. Itâ€™s a good practice to have at least one test for each of your validations and at least one test for every method in your model.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which leads me to&#8230;</p>

<h2>Why I use shoulda</h2>

<p>I think that the best thing is just to take a peek at <a href="http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/rspec_shoulda/">The shoulda cheat sheets</a>.</p>

<p>You actually get a guide of what to test by looking at the cheat sheet! It&#8217;s too bad that it&#8217;s not up to date (actually I think that the whole site is not up to date &#8211; even the gem doesn&#8217;t work anymore, which I think is too bad :-( )</p>

<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s great for lazy people and it&#8217;s definitely easier on the eyes. Just check the following example:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4339197.js?file=shoulda_model.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># without shoulda... tons of code :-)
it &quot;should belong to person&quot; do
    Model.reflect_on_association(:person).macro.should == :belongs_to
end

# with shoulda... one-liner!
it{should belong_to(:person)}
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Convinced? ;-)</p>

<h2>What I test exactly with shoulda</h2>

<p>I go through the whole list of shoulda macros for models, and I just use and abuse them. Since the cheat sheet is not up to date, I created a new one (just for models for now) at:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4339490.js?file=shoulda_cheat_model.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># updated from the original @ http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/rspec_shoulda
# just a subset -- models -- is included here. I'll update this, and create cheat sheets for others, as I go along.
# I marked the ones I added with NEW and also added the links to the corresponding code, as I think it's useful.
# Any comments/corrections are welcome!

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a bit tedious. But (1) you make sure that you are actually testing all these details, which is extremely useful when you are constantly refactoring your code, and (2) it&#8217;s not that slow with the multiple cursors of Sublime Text 2. You just need to have a scaffold.</p>

<h2>What I test without shoulda</h2>

<p>Apart from model methods, is there that much to test without shoulda? I test:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any model methods, extensively</li>
<li>Callbacks, extremely extensively</li>
<li>Some validations - but just to make sure I coded them right. See more of this perspective in <a href="http://www.christopherbloom.com/2011/07/12/testing-model-validations-in-rspec-the-short-and-sweet-way/">Testing model validations in rspec the short and sweet way</a></li>
</ul>


<p>&#8230; and for now, that&#8217;s about it.</p>

<h2>Regarding generating fake data</h2>

<p>Like I mentioned before, I do use FactoryGirl extensively. Maybe that means that <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-07-14-why-i-don-t-like-factory_girl">my models are complicated</a>? I don&#8217;t know, but for now, I am sort of using good sense and stuff. Let&#8217;s see what happens. I do use <a href="http://faker.rubyforge.org">Faker</a> as well. Come to think about it, will do a post on that eventually.</p>

<h2>Random issues in testing models</h2>

<p>When everything seems to be absolutely correct in the models and in the tests and you are still getting unexplainable errors, do restart guard. I already spent several hours messing around with the tests because guard didn&#8217;t refresh the models. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5855587/spork-is-really-great-but-how-can-i-get-it-to-refresh-validations-and-other-cod">There are automatic solutions</a>, but I didn&#8217;t feel like hacking away the spork/guard configurations again&#8230; yet.</p>

<h2>Random resources</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://everydayrails.com/2012/03/19/testing-series-rspec-models-factory-girl.html">Everyday Rails: How I learned to test my Rails applications, Part 3: Model specs</a> - this has a very nice overview of the actual steps required to test models. Now I just cheat using shoulda, but it&#8217;s very nice and useful to get a</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.christopherbloom.com/2011/07/12/testing-model-validations-in-rspec-the-short-and-sweet-way/">Testing model validations in rspec the short and sweet way</a> - it&#8217;s a bit outdated, but describes how to test validations in a short way.</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>Again, as I already mentioned, I am a beginner to rails and, consequently, in testing rails, so I might be doing/saying terribly wrong things. Any input is very much appreciated :-)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know whether this library is very common, but it definitely shows a lot of promise:</p>

<p><a href="http://segmentio.github.com/analytics.js/">Segmentio&#8217;s Analytics.js</a></p>

<p>It provides provider-agnostic hooks to route to analytics services. They also have a hosted version where the analytics services can be changed without touching the code. Looks really clean and neat.</p>

<h2>Nice video: to_proc</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aISNtCAZlMg">This video by CooperPress</a> explains in a very clear fashion how to use the &#8220;to_proc&#8221; feature of Ruby (and understand some weird code you might come across).

<h2>Faster Rails partial rendering and caching</h2>

<p>I sure will try out <a href="http://ninjasandrobots.com/rails-faster-partial-rendering-and-caching/">this gem (multi_fetch_fragments)</a> to optimize Rails when I get to that point of my work&#8230;</p>

		<a href="/blog/2012/12/14/how-i-test/">
		
			How I Test - Part I: Environment</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not that I am an authority in testing&#8230; this is just a compilation of the so-called &#8220;best practices&#8221; that I&#8217;ve been seeing around, as well as some extra tips from my (very limited) experience. I&#8217;d love to hear the feedback from more experienced people&#8230; I&#8217;m going to do several of these as I go along.</p>

<h2>Gems I use</h2>

<p>I test using <a href="http://rspec.info">rspec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda">shoulda</a>, which dramatically reduces the size of the tests. But beware &#8211; rspec is a DSL, and I think that I only got a bit more intuition on what I was exactly testing after doing some tests in Test::Unit. I also use <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">FactoryGirl</a> for setting up the test data, instead of fixtures. Last but not least, the <a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov">simplecov</a> gem is amazing, and although you shouldn&#8217;t rely on it to determine when to stop testing, it really is good to get a (very precise) sense of what&#8217;s covered and what&#8217;s not in their beautiful html reports.</p>

<h2>General tips</h2>

<p>When all your tests are red for no apparent reason, it&#8217;s because you were messing around with the db and then forgot to do</p>

<pre><code>rake db:test:clone</code></pre>


<p>Yup, the reason I am mentioning it here even though it seems completely obvious is because I am distracted and do that a lot&#8230; :-)</p>

<h2>Tips for running guard/spork in vagrant</h2>

<p>I use vagrant to keep my environment all neatly in one place. However, there are downsides. When running guard inside the guest OS, use</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec guard -p</code></pre>


<p>Otherwise, guard won&#8217;t detect changes in the guest filesystem.</p>

<h2>FactoryGirl tips</h2>

<p>You can keep all factories in one file, for me that is more intuitive (and also, I don&#8217;t have to keep opening files while I&#8217;m testing, it&#8217;s all in one place.)</p>

<p>To try FactoryGirl methods in the console, run:</p>

<pre><code>FactoryGirl.find_definitions</code></pre>


<p>At least in my case, I would get a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8409787/factorygirl-factory-not-registered-user-argumenterror">factory not registered</a> error when I didn&#8217;t do that.</p>

<h2>Better Errors</h2>

<p>Not exactly related to testing, but <a href="https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors">this gem</a> has been a life changer! When there is an error, the standard error page gets replaced by a much better and useful error page, which has a full trace, the local and instance variables that are set at the time, and a terminal that you can use to inspect and make changes to the variables in the models and controllers in real time (or code whatever you want). I know I already mentioned it in another post, but I can&#8217;t stress enough how cool this gem is!</p>

<p>In the next posts, I&#8217;ll give an overview of how I test the models and controllers, which I only started testing this week!</p>

			Rails Tip #2 - Less Rspec in More Color</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I usually have Guard running in the background with Spork, but when I&#8217;m writing tests I like to do it the old fashioned way and be able to do rspec some_test | less. The problem with that approach is that we get a monochrome version of our tests. In order to redirect the color in the pipe, edit spec_helper and add the following:</p>

<pre><code> # spec/spec_helper.rb
Rspec.configure do |config|
    config.tty = true
    config.color_enabled = true
    # ... whatever configurations you might have here...
end
</code></pre>


<p>And enjoy a more colorful life ;-)</p>
